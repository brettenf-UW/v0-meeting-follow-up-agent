  summary:
    "The team met to finalize the Q2 roadmap priorities. After discussion, they agreed to focus on four main initiatives: database migration (Priority 1), analytics dashboard redesign (Priority 2), export functionality improvements (Priority 3), and landing page templates (Priority 4). The scope of the dashboard redesign was reduced to focus on the analytics section to accommodate the marketing team's need for landing page templates for their summer campaign.",
  keyDecisions: [
    "Prioritize database migration as the top initiative for Q2",
    "Reduce the scope of dashboard redesign to focus only on the analytics section",
    "Include landing page templates in Q2 roadmap with a May 20th deadline",
    "Schedule weekly check-ins starting next Monday at 10 AM to track progress",
